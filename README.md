# From Prototyping to Worldbuilding

Talk at Lawrence Technological University  
Humanity + Technology Lecture Series    
College of Architecture and Design  
25 March 2021

How and to what effects is prototyping a mode of inquiry in Humanities research and teaching? In this talk, I survey examples across labs and classrooms and then attend to one project in particular: "Remaking the Reading Optophone" at the University of Victoria (UVic). Dating back to the 1910s, reading optophones converted type into audible tones to give blind readers direct access to inkprint materials. Now considered to be "obsolete," they were foundational to the development of optical character recognition (OCR). With researcher, Tiffany Chan, I prototyped early iterations of the reading optophone at UVic to study the labor of translation, which is frequently ignored by historians of media and technology. I conclude this talk by outlining what we learned from "prototyping the past" and how it directed our attention to the practice of worldbuilding.
